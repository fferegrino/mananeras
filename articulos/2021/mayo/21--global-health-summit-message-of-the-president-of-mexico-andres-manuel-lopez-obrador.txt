Presidencia de la República  | 21 de mayo de 2021
I am glad to be taking part in this Global Health Summit. Greetings to my colleagues, the women, men, leaders and public servants of the countries that make up the G20.
I will begin by saying that I welcome and approve President Biden's proposal to make available to the peoples and nations of the world the patents of the pharmaceutical companies that are making and will continue to make COVID-19 vaccines.
I also consider it essential to strengthen the UN mechanism proposed by our country and supported by almost all countries in the world so that COVID vaccines are available to all nations without regard to economic, social or cultural differences.
Unfortunately, it has not worked as it should. It is clear that a small group of countries is hoarding vaccines, while most have very few doses. So far, according to official figures, 1.556 billion vaccines have been administered, with 96 percent concentrated in 50 countries, while 145 countries have only administered 67 million doses, that is, four percent of the total.
Lastly, speaking on behalf of Mexico, I thank the governments of the United States, China, India, and Russia for their solidarity in sending vaccines to our country; I also appreciate the collaboration in the fill-finishing of vaccines from Argentina, and the solidarity and support of the medical brigades from the sister Republic of Cuba.
Mexico will continue to combat the pandemic with a dimension of international solidarity. Vaccines will soon be released from the AstraZeneca and CanSino plants in Mexico for Latin American and Caribbean countries.
Mexico is testing its Patria vaccine. When it is authorized, we will contribute 30 percent of the vaccines produced to the countries that need it.
Thank you.
National Palace, Mexico City.
